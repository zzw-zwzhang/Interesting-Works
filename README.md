  1) Other works have questionedthe correctness of the using the central limit theorem to model the gradient noise as Gaussian [20], arguing that the weak dependence between batches and heavy-tailed structure in the gradient noiseleads the CLT to break down.
  2) The two conditions needed for the CLT (Central Limit Theorem) to hold are not exactly met in the setting of SGD. Independent and identically distributed. Generally we perform SGD by making a complete pass through the entire dataset before using a sample again which introduces a weak dependence between samples. **While the covariance matrix without replacement more accurately models the dependence between samples within a batch, it fails to account for the dependence between batches.** *Finite variance*. A differentline of work has questioned the Gaussian assumption entirely because of the need for finite variance random variables. This work instead suggests using the generalized central limit theorem implying the noise would be a heavy-tailed Î±-stable random variable. Thus, the previous assumption is implicitly assuming the i.i.d. and finite variance conditions apply for large enough datasets and small enough batches.

## Generalization

- [SAM: Sharpness-Aware Minimization for Efficiently Improving Generalization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.01412.pdf), 2021 ICLR
- [Coherent Gradients: An Approach to Understanding Generalization in Gradient Descent-based Optimization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.10657.pdf), 2020 ICLR
  1) We propose an approach to answering this question basedon a hypothesis about the dynamics of gradient descent that we call **Coherent Gradients**: Gradients from similar examples are similar and so the overall gradientis stronger in certain directions where these reinforce each other.  Thus changesto the network parameters during training are biased towards those that (locally)simultaneously benefit many examples when such similarity exists.
  2) Gradients arecoherent, i.e, similar examples (or parts of examples) have similar gradients (or similar components of gradients) and dissimilar examples have dissimilar gradients.
  3) Since the overall gradient is the sum of the per-example gradients, it is stronger in directions where the per-example gradients are similar and reinforce each other and weaker in other directions where they are different and do not add up.
  4) Since network parameters are updated proportionally to gradients, they change faster in the direction of stronger gradients.
  5) Thus the changes to the network during training are biased towards those that simultaneously benefit many examples instead of a few (or one example).
  6) Strong gradient directions are more stable since the presence or absence of a single example does not impact them as much, as opposed to weak gradient directions which may altogether disappear if a specific example is missing from the training set. With this observation, we can reason inductively about the stability of GD: since the initial values of the parameters do not depend on the training data, the initial function mapping examples to their gradients is stable. Now, if all parameter updates are due to strong gradient directions, then stabilityis preserved. However, if some parameter updates are due to weak gradient directions, then stability is diminished.


## Sampling
- [Random Shuffling Beats SGD Only After Many Epochson Ill-Conditioned Problems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.06880.pdf), 2021 arXiv
  1) Recently, there has been much interest in studying the convergence rates of without-replacementSGD, and proving that it is faster than with-replacement SGD in the worst case.
  2) Without-replacement sampling createsstatistical dependencies between the iterations, so the stochastic gradients computed at each iteration can nolonger be seen as unbiased estimates of gradients.
- [Curiously Fast Convergence of someStochastic Gradient Descent Algorithms](https://leon.bottou.org/publications/pdf/slds-2009.pdf), 2009
  1) In fact, the stochastic approximation results rely on randomness assump-tion on the successive choice of examples are independent. Both the cycle and the shuffle break these assumptions but provide a more even coverage of the training set.
  2) What can we prove for thecycleand the shuffle cases?

  1) With-replacement: In many theoretical studies the indices of component functions are assumed to be chosen with replacement, making the choice at each iteration independent of other iterations.
  2) Without-replacement: all the indices are randomly shuffled and are then visited exactly once per epoch (i.e., one pass through all the components). There are two popular
variants of shuffling schemes: one that reshuffles the components at every epoch and another that shuffles only once at the beginning and reuses that order every epoch.
  3) The without-replacement sampling is considerably trickier than their with-replacement counterparts, because the component chosen at each iteration is dependent on the previous iterates of an epoch.
